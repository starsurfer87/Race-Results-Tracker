# Personal Project: Race Results Tracker

## Project Proposal

This application will keep track of an athlete's race results and allow them to view there progress over time with 
respect to their goals. The key idea is that athletes and their coaches will be able to use the app to analyze the 
athlete's results over time in two main ways:
- determine how they have progressed in a particular **event** (e.g. 100m) by seeing their current personal best with 
respect to all past personal bests and their goal time
- determine how they have done at particular **competition** (e.g. Canadian Track & Field Championships) over time by 
being able to view all **races** at a particular **competition**  

While this application will focus on track races specifically, it could be expanded upon by added functionality that 
can provide similar analysis for other categories of events, such as field events, road races, or cross-country running.
 
 
This project is of interest to me because I myself am runner, and am interested in be able to track my own results in 
this way. The idea for this project stemmed from wanting to expand upon the certain features in existing
fitness tracking apps. Namely, I want to allow for greater flexibility of use and better show progress over time rather 
than only current bests.
